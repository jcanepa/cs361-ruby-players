# Players, written in Ruby for OSU-Cascades
A simple program to demonstrate basic OOP in Ruby that creates a collection of 50 players and displays their name & scores.


## Assignment Requirements:

- Write a Ruby program that defines a Player class. Each Player has a name and score, and should always be initialized with a name and score.

- Create an array of fifty Player objects, such that the Player objects in the array have a name like "Player 1", "Player 2", "Player 3" and so on; and that they have a random score, an integer between 10 and 300.

- Now print each of the Player objects in the array, such that we see something like "Ready Player N! Score: S" for each player in the array.
